title: Welcome to Quartz
---

There's nothing here yet!

If you need to do something like do work this on some other pc, just  `npx quartz build --serve` in the root directory, and you should be good to go 👍

( `npm install quartz` should calm npx down if errors happen, but idk :P )

Also loading times are gonna be bad cuz github pages probably won't keep this running 24/7 😔
